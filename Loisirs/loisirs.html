                    <article>As a dedicated Information Technology student, I am deeply immersed in the complexities and opportunities that programming languages offer. This passion for programming drives me to constantly explore new technologies and coding techniques, allowing me to stay at the forefront of innovation and problem-solving. Outside the classroom, 
                        I find discipline and focus through the art of boxing. This sport is more than just physical exercise to me; it embodies discipline, strategic thinking, and resilience. The rigorous training, combined with the mental and physical demands of boxing, instills in me a strong sense of determination and perseverance.
                         These qualities are directly transferable to my professional life, enhancing my ability to tackle challenges with confidence and tenacity. I also dedicate time to playing video games, particularly Souls-like titles such as Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and the Dark Souls series, which sharpen my problem-solving skills and strategic planning under pressure. 
                         These interests highlight my commitment to personal growth, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence in both my academic and professional endeavors.
